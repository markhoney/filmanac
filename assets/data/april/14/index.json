However, his task is a race against time, for peace may come at any time, and if it comes before the amendment is passed, the returning southern states will stop it before it can become law. Lincoln must, by almost any means possible, obtain enough votes from a recalcitrant Congress before peace arrives and it is too late. Yet the president is torn, as an early peace would save thousands of lives. As the nation confronts its conscience over the freedom of its entire population, Lincoln faces his own crisis of conscience -- end slavery or end the war.","year":{"id":"2012","path":"/released/2012/"},"score":{"id":"73","number":73},"votes":237893,"runtime":150,"awards":"Won 2 Oscars.

Titanic's sinking from the standpoint of 2nd Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller, himself the most senior of the ill-fated ship's Deck Officers to survive the disaster. (Lightoller later went on to distinguish himself as a line British Naval Officer during the First World War and served as a Senior Naval Staff Officer (convoys) during WWII. Between wars he owned and operated a successful family business producing pleasure craft.) His own survival of the sinking, along with several others, is shown atop one of the liner's two \"collapsible\" lifeboats which was capsized in floating off the liner as it sank. The picture depicts then known facts (c1958) as reported after the sinking; such as the woeful lack of adequate lifeboats, the ship's band playing true to the very end, White Star's co-owner Bruce Ismay's somewhat less than chivalrous departure from the sinking vessel -and- the Titanic's designer (Andrews, on-board) revelation that due to the severity of below-the-water-line damage and that the vaunted watertight compartments were not designed to nor sealed up to the weather deck, would only delay the inevitable as sea water spilled over the top of one to the next from the bows to the stern. It also addresses the mysterious ship seen from the Titanic's bridge stopped some 12-19 miles off and depicts it as being the S.S. Californian, whom - if that steamship had responded, the loss of life could have been far, far less. The Californian is seen stopped due to the ice warnings, the same alerts whose import were undervalued by the Titanic's Captain Smith. She herself had shut-down wireless operations, nominally at 11:00pm as her sole operator retired for the evening, this before the iceberg was struck and the 1st distress calls were made by Titanic. It also addresses somewhat the coal fire in one of Titanic's bunkers - apparently not uncommon back in those days, before her departure into the Atlantic and potential for damage to steel plates below the water line. (This picture predates the calling-into-question of the quality of rivets (metalurgy) which has since come to the fore.) The film also shows the class distinction and its impact as to whom - of the \"women and children first,\" got a seat in a boat; the fact that the first/earliest lifeboats launched were not at full capacity; and that the boats launched from the port and starboard side held to different criteria as to loading. The latter allows the viewer an inference as to the importance for crew and passenger alike as to lifeboat drills which were then (1912) neither required nor ever held aboard Titanic. One of several movies on the subject, it stands well the test-of-time for its \"just the facts\" approach in the telling and avoidance of conjecture or added melodrama.","year":{"id":"1958","path":"/released/1958/"},"score":{"id":"79","number":79},"votes":13027,"runtime":123,"awards":"Won 1 Golden Globe.

Cold Blood","plot":"In meeting in Kansas, ex-cons Perry Smith and Dick Hickock are breaking several conditions of their respective paroles. The meeting, initiated by Dick, is to plan and eventually carry out a robbery based on information he had received from a fellow inmate about $10,000 cash being locked in a hidden safe in the home of the farming Clutter family of Holcomb, Kansas. After the robbery, they plan on going to Mexico permanently to elude capture by the police. Each brings a necessary personality to the partnership to carry out the plan, Dick who is the brash manipulator, Perry the outwardly more sensitive but unrealistic dreamer with a violent streak under the surface. Perry literally carries all his dreams in a large box he takes with him wherever he goes. The robbery does not go according to plan in any respect, the pair who ultimately hogtie and execute all four members of the Clutter family, only coming away from the home with $43 in cash. As Perry and Dick go on the run, a murder investigation ensues, led by Topeka based Detective Alvin Dewey. If Dewey and his team are able eventually to identify the pair as the murderers and capture them, they, if they understand the two, may get their much needed confessions in dividing and conquering. Perry and Dick's fates may also be regardless of who literally pulled the trigger.","year":{"id":"1967","path":"/released/1967/"},"score":{"id":"79","number":79},"votes":22754,"runtime":134,"awards":"Nominated for 4 Oscars.

November 16, 1959, Truman Capote reads about the murder of a Kansas family. There are no suspects. With Harper Lee, he visits the town: he wants to write about their response. First he must get locals to talk, then, after arrests, he must gain access to the prisoners. One talks constantly; the other, Perry Smith, says little. Capote is implacable, wanting the story, believing this book will establish a new form of reportage: he must figure out what Perry wants. Their relationship becomes something more than writer and character: Perry killed in cold blood, the state will execute him in cold blood; does Capote get his story through cold calculation, or is there a price for him to pay?","year":{"id":"2006","path":"/released/2006/"},"score":{"id":"70","number":70},"votes":15991,"runtime":110,"awards":"3 wins & 2 nominations.","images":{"poster":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/tt0420609.6d0d83a.88fd337f7bc20b0a38477263be2b43ab.jpg","size":{"width":200,"height":300},"sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px","srcset":["/assets/static/tt0420609.6d0d83a.88fd337f7bc20b0a38477263be2b43ab.jpg 200w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 200 300' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-fdc0477d018ae4d6e0e25d4df052674e'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-fdc0477d018ae4d6e0e25d4df052674e)' width='200' height='300' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bRXPTPxTbGUSLc1tLTzAaQht5xJbG4KLeMjBPGfuPxSxeQ3FeS4lpe0EDdjOd3kY8f3rddRRdH6bYjKvFqiNIkOHZsh7xkDycDjg0L5ZLPM0Um6aXslunPSVtsQj%2bmSRuWvZ4UODnI5ryIeJKbTUHUnV%2bh1S4zj1sujCYsplc5fWyqLhWMeRweQPf7VMEWxVufUgH9Y0pLaONoKRjvUMnuVuP47fVJXqwXSLrGDbdRRm7Y7ILYUGG0hAbJxuSEcHgHxzmtWkWTRzUZcWNb5a1dPeX2QFbinGM/1A8/1AD812TmopV%2bhIYnK7dGZs3Rm3NRGo0CMt2Y24w66tStyQXE4OAcZGBimep5USTfpoisNssJJZy0tRB25SVnPPJGceKeaxsyLM41NtNwD7KO9KVELLfd7HIBz6NM7xqZ6%2bw4LDcCHFlIBbfMNgJXKUTlKj5JP4Hvn3TR%2b6lFCTi4/S2R62mokQyFqbeO9ISgpKkkcg55/HFRbj%2b91eMJQpRwkD7R6rS1aH1FYNMpvchq0yWUpL70SU0HXGkYwAoEYyc/bnIq1aWuGhL9IYimyW6Fc1nYGnI6Nq1AchKv8A1HNy/KWyi5L8eg0cDfTdF0%2boOmI8q2uj/fuuvHcywyor3PcDtGDjt/YceuaPQseCdL2mFAuiJzCGsrAd6qWHNx7CEgAEK5z54JB8VR/qp9T4z65LOm7up1sxFRElhZShRdx1HDwMkI7E/BKjWe/Se6W%2b16o691vAttuQ31HE7CsPrSQUJ2j2DyCQcYqPG403gjt0/YefISnVHoiZbESLjaJYtBej26XhcyO2FJa3E7sHOQkrwTjPGfFPLrHXMuCm7SJ36YK6S/0sssJOR3BWEnd49%2bMCs%2bm/XeHa4zlss7IdCzvVMZXsSTgAjarJ9cZPjFRNn%2buAt8lx2Wu4vlSeEh9Kk5H%2bOKd4ZRpJNlI57tyo0jXca0/6Jkoeiq/ULO1wIZLi3XRkpThI5JI8%2bByaqf0r0LbLRdbRfGQ7IjiAp5apjQS6xKCthO3PCdqiR5%2b3zTa4/xG3OUwtm3MwYjODvVIJWojHhIHuoJH1Tj3NiQ8/MNtuQQAFsrKUuknB%2bQBgk4PuiWKaVRv4BTUmnKvk1DXFoZuWnrtAg9NibcFpWwVO7eu4pQB2895CNxx6om9D2tKbRZ4LcVtmE41LecDI6yw2c/zPJKl8nI4HHFYFYdbvJ1bFu9ymsrXDPO7sS%2bgcFsBIwMgnkAc%2baea%2b1zHma9l3nTNxfisNpQ3FeaWUuqCcZUoKHOcng/FEuNlcdE/6ZLkQ7ZmpORSZGa6RyacNtbiK9NujiSsSSyS0XCQEg45PNIFRCiAn8cjmp5iJ1Iyxg9vOPRpdEdh%2bQky2S2%2bCFBSVZ3485A/GKn5qRrx%2bxWUnJweKU2ZBKclPzUlehE2oS1y8FHcoDnH5qP6zYACW9g4B7if%2b6opbK0hK1dMSUjFJkU6WB6II%2baSIpkzHEJte2pGKpxTK3CwvpAY3hJIz%2b/j2P8A2ooVe9P31q2aJW2HWHXFOvJdhuL/AJzSlx8pI84IQo5HIKcjxSzRsZUNLetAjPPPMv8AQQAonpq24/fxUM%2b6iQ%2btTKXCSCocdwA9/jj%2b1XSTNsT%2bn7dbkz98TrJUsuOlDjLYQtSkqT4UrB2fBURjzTV%2b9wVXOHqaK%2byuUzHcafiPoS2XVJw2kbAT2qacCc/8ajU446djSyMozqThS0AqSVbMgHz%2b/wAmuHI77e4OMuo2gKIUgjAPAJ/FaLCn2SLCuVph3FoRUK68OU5lKg860tAJ99iS2gkfaQpQqLt85hOjLjZZctlVxeJXGKngpLaAttSmy5nHeUZAzjKfRVzVMk2VJtt0MlRad2ABW7YcYPg5pMkD5q7XmZBkabiRH5DJUxbW%2bi9HkAqS6PuZcQD3JUMc/wBJGc4yKohNauzdgqPNFQphQ80M8UVCgA6KhQoAFChQoA//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}},"classification":{"title":"R","path":"/classifications/r/"},"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Biography","image":"/img/genres/Biography.png","path":"/genres/biography/"},{"title":"Crime","image":"/img/genres/Crime.png","path":"/genres/crime/"},{"title":"Drama","image":"/img/genres/Drama.png","path":"/genres/drama/"}],"countries":[{"title":"USA","image":"/img/countries/maps/United States of America.png","path":"/countries/usa/"}],"languages":[{"title":"English","image":"/img/countries/flags/gb.svg","path":"/languages/english/"}]}},{"id":"4-14-tt0379725","title":"Truman Capote attends the executions of Richard Hickock and Perry Smith","info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hickock#Execution"}},"year":{"id":"1965","path":"/years/1965/"},"dayofyear":{"month":{"title":"April","path":"/april/"},"day":{"id":"14","ordinal":"th"}},"refreshments":[],"mention":"","movie":{"id":"tt0379725","path":"/movie/tt0379725/","title":"Capote","plot":"Famed writer Truman Capote, southern born and bred but now part of the New York City social circle, is growing weary of his current assignment of writing autobiographical type pieces for the New Yorker. After reading a newspaper article about the just occurred November 14, 1959 cold blooded murders of the Clutter family in their rural Kansas home, Truman feels compelled to write about that event as his next article. So he and his personal assistant Nelle Harper Lee, also a southern born New Yorker and an aspiring writer of her own, head to Kansas to research the story first-hand. Truman hopes to use his celebrity status to gain access to whomever he needs, such as to Laura Kinney, a friend of the Clutter daughter she who discovered the bodies, and to Alvin Dewey, the lead police investigator and also a Clutter family friend. If his celebrity doesn't work, Truman will grease the wheels by whatever means necessary. When the police eventually charge suspects, two young men named Dick Hickcock and Perry Smith, Truman uses those same tactics to gain access to them. Truman's fascination with the story makes him believe that he can revolutionize writing by expanding the germ of the article into what he calls a non-fiction novel. His personal involvement also changes as he grows emotionally attached to Perry, the seemingly sensitive and thus probable submissive in the criminal pairing, thus Truman becoming part of the story itself. Article or non-fiction novel, Truman knows that he has to take it to its natural conclusion, something which he cannot force. But also missing are the details of the November 14, 1959 event itself, something that neither Dick or Perry have divulged even in testimony.","year":{"id":"2005","path":"/released/2005/"},"score":{"id":"73","number":73},"votes":121983,"runtime":114,"awards":"Won 1 Oscar.
